Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to examine trends and uncover relationships among the variables. Subsequently, data correlation analysis was performed to identify key features influencing the target variable. The dataset was then split into training and testing subsets to facilitate model evaluation.

Four machine learning models were considered for this task: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Following the training and testing phase, the models achieved the following accuracy scores:

Linear Regression: 99.9%
Random Forest: 99.8%
Decision Trees: 99.7%
Support Vector Machine (SVM): 24.9%
Linear Regression emerged as the best-performing model, achieving the highest accuracy. Consequently, it was selected for stock price prediction, with the results deemed highly relevant to the study's objectives.
